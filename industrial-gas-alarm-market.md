<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Gas Alarm Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catalytic Type</li><li>Infrared Optical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Industrial Gas Alarm market offers two primary types: Catalytic Type and Infrared Optical. Catalytic Gas Alarms detect combustible gases by utilizing a catalytic bead that reacts with the gas, producing heat and triggering an alarm. Infrared Optical Gas Alarms, on the other hand, employ infrared light to identify gas concentrations; when gas particles absorb specific wavelengths, the changes are measured to initiate an alarm. Both types enhance safety in industrial environments by effectively monitoring hazardous gas levels.</p></p>
