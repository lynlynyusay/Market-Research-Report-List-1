<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HLA Typing Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Serotyping"</li><li>"DNA Typing"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HLA Typing Services encompass two primary market types: Serotyping and DNA Typing. Serotyping involves the use of antibody-based methods to identify specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules present on cell surfaces, typically through techniques like cell mixing or microcytotoxicity. In contrast, DNA Typing leverages molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, to analyze genetic material for HLA gene variations. Both types are crucial for applications in transplantation, disease association studies, and personalized medicine.</p></p>
