<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cohesive Viscoelastic</li><li>Low Viscosity Dispersion Viscoelastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ophthalmic viscoelastic agent (OBA) market features two primary types: cohesive viscoelastic and low viscosity dispersion viscoelastic. Cohesive viscoelastic agents possess higher viscosity and are used to maintain anterior chamber stability during cataract surgery, providing effective support and protection to ocular tissues. In contrast, low viscosity dispersion viscoelastic agents have lower viscosity, facilitating better flow and filling of the eye's anterior chamber, enhancing visibility and controlling intraocular pressure during surgical procedures. Both types play critical roles in ophthalmic surgeries.</p></p>
