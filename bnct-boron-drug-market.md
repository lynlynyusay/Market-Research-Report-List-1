<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BNCT Boron Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Molecule Boron Drugs</li><li>Boron-bound Biological Complexes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The BNCT boron drug market comprises two primary types: small molecule boron drugs and boron-bound biological complexes. Small molecule boron drugs are low molecular weight compounds that effectively target and deliver boron to tumor cells, enhancing neutron capture therapy. In contrast, boron-bound biological complexes involve larger biomolecules, such as antibodies or peptides, that are covalently linked to boron compounds, enabling selective targeting of cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Both approaches optimize the therapeutic potential of boron neutron capture therapy.</p></p>
